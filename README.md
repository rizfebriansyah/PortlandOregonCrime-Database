# PortlandOregonCrime-Database
 
I have selected information about Portland, Oregon's crime statistics. The information given is trustworthy because it was obtained from civicapps.org and portlandoregon.gov.   

The information displays crime statistics for the years 2015 to 2017. Each reported crime includes a location, a time and date, as well as the neighbourhood in which the incident took place.  

The top crime hotspots and the most frequently committed offences can be determined using this dataset. Several parties and organisations may consider these details to be essential.

The police force, to start. If they are aware of the Portland neighbourhood that experiences the most crimes, they can increase patrols and police presence there. This is done to discourage crime from occurring there. The police could also look into the most frequent offences that had been reported over the previous years, investigate the situation, and possibly enact new legislation or impose stiffer penalties to lower the number of offences. In order to possibly educate the public and increase awareness, the police and the government can also collaborate.  

If crime rates continue to decline in the upcoming years, Portland's economy may also grow as a result. The city's economy would benefit as more visitors would feel secure arriving to take advantage of what Portland has to offer.

I would also like to know if there is a correlation between the US law allowing gun ownership and the amount of crime rates since I am from an Asian nation where gun ownership is illegal.

This makes it a fascinating dataset to work with because we can respond to inquiries like:  
• How has crime changed over time?  
• Is it possible to foresee the location or timing of a crime's commission? What parts of the city have changed during this time?  
• Where are crimes most frequently committed? What types of crimes occur most frequently?  
• Which areas are most likely to see particular crimes?  
• Does the number of crimes fluctuate throughout the day? Month? Year?
